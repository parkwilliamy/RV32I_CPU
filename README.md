# RISClet

- RISClet is 32-bit processor based on the RISC-V architecture
- The goal is to implement RISClet on the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA
- Optimizing performance through pipelining, hazard detection, and branch prediction

# Verification Outline

- This project uses the official RISC-V compliance tests with the RISCOF framework for the RV32I ISA
- For more details on the tests, visit https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test
